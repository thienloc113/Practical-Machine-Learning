## Overview

In this project I will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. I will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that I will need to do a thousand simulations.


## Loading libraries

Loading necessary libraries for the report

```{r libraries, results='hide', warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
      
```

## Simulations
Firstly, Set seed and other parameters for reproducability later
```{r set seed}
set.seed(11)
lambda <- 0.2
n <- 40 
```

Then, I generation a list of 40 vectors consisting of 1000 exponential random variables
```{r simulation}
sim_exp <- replicate(1000, rexp(n, lambda))
```

## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean (Question 1)
*Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.*  
Calculate mean of each exponentials
```{r each_mean}
each_mean <- apply(sim_exp, 2, mean)
```
      
Calculate sample mean
```{r sample mean}
sam_mean <- mean(each_mean)
sam_mean
```

Calculate theoretical mean
```{r theo_mean}
theory_mean <- 1/lambda
theory_mean
```
Compare and show in figure. The sample mean is shown in blue line and theoretical mean is shown in red line
```{r figure compare mean}
      ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x = each_mean), bins = 15, alpha = 0.5
                                , color="black") + 
            geom_vline(aes(xintercept = theory_mean),col = 'red') + 
            geom_vline(aes(xintercept = sam_mean), col = "blue") + 
            labs(x = "Means", y = "Frequency", title = "Exponential Function Simulations")
```
      
The analytics mean is `r sam_mean` and the theoretical mean is `r theory_mean`. So, The center of distribution of averages of 40 exponentials is near to the theoretical center of the distribution.

## Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance (Question 2)
*Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.*
Variance of distribution
```{r var of dist}
stan_sd_dist <- sd(each_mean)
var_dist <- stan_sd_dist^2
var_dist
```
Theoretical variance of the distribution

```{r}
var_theory <- ((1/lambda)*(1/sqrt(n)))^2
var_theory
```

The Variance of distribution is `r var_dist` and Theoretical variance of the distribution is `r var_theory`

## Distribution. (Question 3)
*Show that the distribution is approximately normal*  
Letâ€™s plot the distribution of a thousands means in ggplot2
```{r dis_figure}
# Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x = each_mean, y = ..density..), bins = 40,
                          alpha = 0.5, color="black", fill = "orange") + 
      stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = sam_mean, 
                        sd = stan_sd_dist), size = 0.8, lty = 5) +
      labs(x = "Means", y = "Density", title = "Density of Mean")
```

Also qqplot are used to compare sample distributions with a normal distribution.
If the qqplot draws a straight line it can be said that the distribution of the sample is normal.
```{r qqplot}
# compare the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials to a normal distribution
qqnorm(each_mean)
qqline(each_mean, col = 3) 
```
The normal Q-Q Plot also shows that the distribution of the samples means has a normal distribution.  
  
  
**Due to the central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials is approximately equal to a normal distribution.**
